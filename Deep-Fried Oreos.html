        <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
